Also updated some miscellaneous html template files to allow sellers to add existing products and improve flow between pages.

- Amy Weng (Social Guru) --> Main designer of feedback, upvotes, and messages tables. 
    For the final project, Amy changed all feedback tables to DataTables with sorted in reverse chronological order by default, implemented an upvote functionality, pinned the top three upvoted reviews for sellers and products, and incorporated appropriate links to add or edit feedback on the detailed order page, the detailed product page, and sellers’ public profile pages if the constraints are satisfied (i.e., the user has purchased from that seller before). Moreover, Amy implemented the messages inbox and private threads, and she revised the product feedback relation in the database to also include the file path to an image uploaded by the reviewer.  Amy revised db/data/feedback.py to generate sample product feedback data with image file paths and messages between users.
