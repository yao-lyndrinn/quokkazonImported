Team members:
- Phillip Ding (User Guru) --> Main designer of user and purchases tables
- Jonathan Shi (Seller Guru) --> Main designer of seller and inventory tables
- Amy Weng (Social Guru) --> Main designer of feedback and messages tables. For milestone 3, Amy wrote the app/feedback.py, models/feedback.py, allfeedback.html, and myfeedback.html files, and she put the corresponding links into index.html. IMPORTANT: Since recording the demo video, Amy has improved her endpoints for this milestone by allowing a user to view all feedback on the site. On this all_feedback page, users can query for the top 5 most recent feedback any user has left. Moreover, a logged-in user can view and sort both product and seller feedback on their own specific feedback record. The team's repository currently does not include the code for the older endpoints showed in the demo video. For the newest feedback endpoints, please see the Addendum (linked below) for a short video demonstration. These revisions were made to better fit the given instructions.
- Lyndrinn Yao (Carts Guru) --> Main designer of carts table
- Elise Zhang (Products Guru) --> Main designer of products, tags, and categories table

Everyone worked together to customize the website.
