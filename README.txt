Team: Query Quokkas

Team members:
- Phillip Ding (User Guru) --> Main designer of user and purchases tables. 
For the final project, Phillip created a user lookup page for looking up any user based on their name or components of their name. The user search results page is also paginated and redirects to a user's public profile. Phillip also added features to the user profile page that allows users to top-up their balance and edit their information (following the constraints for registration) .
For milestone 3, Phillip wrote app/allpurchases.py and app/templates/allpurchases.html which allows someone to enter a uid and receive a table of all purchases by that user. Phillip also updated app/__init__.py to include this additional page as well as app/templates/index.html to include a button widget to access the allpurchases page. Features that have been added since the last milestone: Users now have a dedicated profile page, users can now check their profile information, users can now register as sellers and gain access to all seller functionalities.

- Jonathan Shi (Seller Guru) --> Main designer of seller and inventory tables. For milestone 4, Jonathan wrote app/templates/editInventory.html, app/templates/orders.html and modified app/allpurchases.py, app/inventory.py, app/models/inventory.py, app/models/purchase.py. The inventory display has been updated to exclude product ID, sellers can now add, edit, and remove items from their inventory, as well as view and fulfill their orders plus add existing products to their inventory from the products page. Also updated some miscellaneous html template files to allow sellers to add existing products and improve flow between pages.

- Amy Weng (Social Guru) --> Main designer of feedback, upvotes, and messages tables. 
    For the final project, Amy changed all feedback tables to DataTables with sorted in reverse chronological order by default, implemented an upvote functionality, pinned the top three upvoted reviews for sellers and products, and incorporated appropriate links to add or edit feedback on the detailed order page, the detailed product page, and sellersâ€™ public profile pages if the constraints are satisfied (i.e., the user has purchased from that seller before). Moreover, Amy implemented the messages inbox and private threads, and she revised the product feedback relation in the database to also include the file path to an image uploaded by the reviewer. Amy also revised db/data/feedback.py to generate sample product feedback data with image file paths and messages between users. 
    For milestone 4, Amy created myfeedback_edit.html and myfeedback_add.html, and she expanded the my_feedback.html, app/feedback.py and model/feedback.py files that she had created for the third milestone. She also wrote db/data/feedback.py to generate the two feedback CSV files, wrote the functions to generate users and purchases (gen_users and gen_purchases) in db/generated/gen.py, and modified the app/products.py and productDetail.html files to incorporate feedback details into individual product pages. Moreover, she updated index.html to place buttons to add or edit feedback next to each purchased product. 

- Lyndrinn Yao (Carts Guru) --> Main designer of carts table. For Milestone 4, Lyndrinn updated app/cart.py, app/models/cart.py, app/templates/cart.html, index.html, app/purchases.py, and wrote app/templates/sellerselection.html and app/templates/buyerorder.html. Features that have been added since the last milestone are the ability to view all sellers selling a product, add a product to the cart from a seller, update the quantity of an item in the cart, removing an item from the cart, displaying a calculated total price of items in the cart, and being able to submit the cart as an order, emptying the cart, updating the Purchases table and updating user balances accordingly.
