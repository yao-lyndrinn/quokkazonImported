Team members:
- Phillip Ding (User Guru) --> Main designer of user and purchases tables
- Jonathan Shi (Seller Guru) --> Main designer of seller and inventory tables
- Amy Weng (Social Guru) --> Main designer of feedback and messages tables. For milestone 3, Amy wrote the app/feedback.py, models/feedback.py, allfeedback.html, and myfeedback.html files, and she put the corresponding links onto index.html. IMPORTANT: Since recording the demo video, Amy has improved her endpoints for this milestone by implementing two pages to allow a user to see all feedback on the site and a logged-in user's specific feedback record. On the all_feedback page, users can query for the top 5 most recent feedback any user has left. The team's repository currently does not include the older implementation showed in the demo video. For the newest feedback endpoints, please see the Addendum for a short video demonstration. These revisions were made to better fit the given instructions.
- Lyndrinn Yao (Carts Guru) --> Main designer of carts table
- Elise Zhang (Products Guru) --> Main designer of products, tags, and categories table
